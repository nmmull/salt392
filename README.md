# `saltN`: A Series of Rusty Interpreters

This is a collection of interpreteres use for the course `CAS CS 392 M1`: *Rust, In Practice and in Theory* at Boston University (Fall 2025).
They are based on *Featherweight Rust* [[David J. Pierce 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3443420))], which is based on a number of important previous systems, notably the early operational intepretations of linear logic [[Turner and Wadler 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397599000547)].
The motivation for these systems is entirely pedogogical; I wanted a more gradual approach (Ã  la [[Pierce 2002](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/)]) to Featherweight Rust which motivated the necessary formalisms.
